# JavaScript, jQuery, User Input & Some Responsive Design
## Homework #2

## Overview
For the second assignment we will be working on learning how JavaScript and jQuery can allow us to create some really awesome responsive features in our websites, take some information from the user and also be able to do something with that information! We will also be working on some aspects of our version control skills including : `branching`, `merging` and `checkout`. Alright lets jump into what we have done with this!

This project was challenging in the way that I found myself spending a huge amount of time just creating different effects and researching how particular sites like [Wavelength Studios](http://www.wavelengthstudio.com) and [REI](https://www.rei.com/) were getting the types of styles that they were. This project really let me dive deep into UI design and style and got me really excited about starting to do my own web development outside of class.

I decided in the my initial planning that I would continue to work off of my site from homework#1 because I wanted to be able to eventually use the site as a template for how to create a fully functioning webpage. Though the majority of the new code would be going into two new pages: the [ordering page](https://sonicscape211.github.io/460hw/hw2/small-business-ordering-page.html) and the [checkout page](https://sonicscape211.github.io/460hw/hw2/checkout-page.html).
