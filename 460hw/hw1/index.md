# HTML, CSS & BOOTSTRAP
## Homework #1
===

## Overview
   This is the first assignment for Western Oregon's Software Engineering I course. I am required to create a basic webpage on a subject of interest to me using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I have worked a bit within the first two items here, although this will be my first experiece working with Bootstrap. For my topic I have chosen to create a generic modern webpage layout targeting small businesses as throughout this course I will be working towards developing a small, freelance website development business to boost my resume and provide some extra income this year.
   Alright, let's get started!

## Stage One
   I started out on this project by creating and initializing a new repo for my GitHub account. I have used GitHub in the past, but I actually only just recently started using Git Bash, though it seems simple enough (I suppose I'll find out...). 
   Now that I have created a repo to store all of my files I decided to brush up on my HTML and CSS work. I had learned a lot of it during the winter break last year, though after that I didn't have much time to keep using it, so my skills are definitely rusty.
   After picking up the basics again from a course on Udemy.com, I downloaded Bootstrap and jumped into the documentation on their site. I already had something in mind for my homepage. I really wanted to keep most of the information to one page, I donâ€™t personally enjoy jumping around from page to page on websites, so here I am going to try and keep the layout pleasant and allow the user to move around the front page with a fixed menu bar at the top of the screen.
