# John (JT) Mozingo's Portfolio
### Hey welcome! You have found the compilation site for all of my previous work and current projects.


### About Me
   I am currently a senior at Western Oregon University in their computer sciences program and much of the work that will be referenced in this site will be related to that. Though in the future I will be adding sections for personal projects that I have done outside of the classroom.  
   Though for now if you would like to view my GitHub profile please click on the button at the top page and if you would like to view my Linkedin profile [just click here](http://www.linkedin.com/in/JohnTMozingo).
